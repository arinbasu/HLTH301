## Cause and effect
A is a cause of Y if:
- A precedes Y in time
- if A is validly associated with Y

A valid association between A and Y is deemed when:
- The association between A and Y cannot  be accounted for due to chance,
- When a third variable L cannot explain the association between A and Y,
- When the association between A and Y cannot be due to observation, 
reporting,
or measurement errors referred to as biases.

Only after we have ruled out the play of chance,
eliminated biases,
and controlled for confounding variables,
we will be able to state A and Y have a valid association between them. 
But presence of such association does not necessarily mean that they are causally linked with each other.
This is why it is often said that correlation does not prove causation. 
What factors must we consider before we can state that an association is also causal?
There are several ways in which such associations can be discussed in the context of health sciences.
In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill identified nine viewpoints,
which later were used as 'Hill's Criteria' @hill1965. 
These are:
1. Strength of association
2. Consistency
3. Biological gradient
4. Temporality
5. Replicability

However, these conditions were not always met in all situations.
In 1987, 
Rothman and Greenland came up with the theory of counterfactual theories of causation,
where they showed that causal models can be constructed such that they would be necessary and sufficient[@rothman].
A sufficient causal model is one where different causal factors combine to cause the event. 
A necessary causal variable is one that must be present in all the different sufficient causal models.
But how do we know the extent to which
